one of the difficulties in the prediction of whole brain activity lies in the lack of datasets, we have connectome and whole brain activity recording data for some animals including the zebrafish and fruit fly, but those data are separate. we have connectome fruit fly but don't have a good recording of activity, while we have single neuron activity recording for zebrafish, we still don't have the connectome for them. 

another difficulty is current model is not suitable for the task. models including RNN are designed for neuron level, treating each neuron as the same structure, while the difference between neurons is incredibly huge.
while the snn is applied to the whole brain, the detail parameter need to be tuned, which is almost impossible for the whole brain.
