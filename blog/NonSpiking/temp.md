Implications for motion circuits: The graded nature of T4/T5 makes sense in the context of the Reichardt/Hassenstein–Reichardt correlator model. The correlation and nonlinear amplification steps occur through summing and comparing analog signals ￼ ￼. T4/T5 then provide a continuous direction-selective output that lobula plate neurons integrate. Spiking is not necessary at this stage and might even degrade the precise timing needed for motion detection. Instead, any thresholding to generate spikes for downstream motor commands occurs later in the pathway (e.g. in lobula plate tangential cells or descending neurons). In sum, T4 and T5 are effectively nonspiking neurons, with T4 having direct patch evidence of only graded release (and at most minuscule spikelets) ￼, and T5 presumed to behave similarly based on circuit logic and comparative studies.
