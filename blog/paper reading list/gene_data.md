• Spatial transcriptomic data provide evidence for the mosaic hypothesis in the mouse cortex
• Somata of neurons of the same type appear to avoid spatial proximity with each other
• This “homotypic avoidance” disappears when different cell types are merged
• A point process analysis method offers an objective way to evaluate purity of cell types
