In short, we want to use the RL learning method to find out the genetic decoding for the network connection in the brian.

Our brain is a very complex network, and each neuron will have a particular preference for its connection.
This preference is determined by the genetic information of the neuron.

people have done lots of work trying to find out the importance genes for the network connection.

both in experiment and in theory:
experiment:
    Brain wiring determinants uncovered by integrating connectomes and transcriptomes  
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223010631

theory: 
    Uncovering the genetic blueprint of the C. elegans nervous system 
    https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009093117

    Deciphering the Genetic Code of Neuronal Type Connectivity: A Bilinear Modeling Approach  
    https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/91532

and in our project, we want to use the method in this paper.
the idea of RL method is very similar, just need to change their data (use protein expression to predict neuron type) to our data(use gene predict to the connection).

In the future, if we know the genetic decoding rule for the brain, we can change the gene to build a new network in our brain, which will make our brain super intelligent.
