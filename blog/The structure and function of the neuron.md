> By altering the number of expansion layer neurons (Kenyon cells) and their dendritic complexity,   
we find that input number, but not cell number, tunes odor selectivity. 

 
### comment: 
It is interesting! 
If it is true, the neuron will work as a unit. They receive input from different numbers of synapses, and it will be activated, only if the number reaches a threshold.

It will be a standard graph.

> ventral-stream modules do not represent clusters of circuits that each evolved to process some specific object category particularly important for survival, but instead reflect the effects of experience on a domain-general architecture that evolved to be able to adapt, within a lifetime, to its particular environment. 

 
### comment: 
The domain of face recognition has a significant overlap with the domain of curve.

It indicates that face recognition might be the result of curve recognition. 

I want to emphasize that the high-level function of the human brain is combined with or originated from some basic functions.

### comment: 
The function of computing the direction is associated with the neuron's structure.

Unilateral tree structure will lead to the specialization for moving direction of the edge.

## Multisensory learning binds neurons into a cross-modal memory engram

Integration of Parallel Opposing Memories Underlies Memory Extinction 

### comment: 
They found a type of neuron that can combine the information from two kinds of sensories. 
This function is supported by their special structure(see the figure for detail).
More importantly, the place for connection(information integration) is DAN, a type of dopamine neuron, which means it might be the basis of learning and memory.

It might be a toy model for associate learning( the most important function of the human brain).

## Single cortical neurons as deep artificial neural networks
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627321005018
- Cortical neurons are well approximated by a deep neural network (DNN) with 5–8 layers
- DNN’s depth arises from the interaction between NMDA receptors and dendritic morphology
- Dendritic branches can be conceptualized as a set of spatiotemporal pattern detectors
- We provide a unified method to assess the computational complexity of any neuron type
